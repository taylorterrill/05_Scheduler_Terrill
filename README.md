# Work Day Schedule by Taylor Terrill

University of Utah Programming Bootcamp Challenge 5

The following is a daily work planner application.

When the user types a task in any of the rows and clicks 'save', their task will be saved to local storage. The rows respond to the time of day using moment.js to color code hours that are in the past or future.
